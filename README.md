### Creating a New Password File

2. You’ll be directed to a page where you can add new password entries for websites.

### Uploading an Existing Password File

1. Select "Upload an Already Existing File" on the home page.
2. **Upload File**: Choose the encrypted file you want to decrypt.
3. **Enter Master Password**: Input the master password to decrypt the file.
   - **Note**: If the password is incorrect, you’ll see an "Invalid Password" error. Reload the page to retry.

### Adding New Entries

After decrypting the file or when creating a new password file, you can add new entries:
1. Click **Add New Entry**.
2. Fill out the fields in the popup: Website Name, Email, Username, Password, and any additional notes.

## Tips for Secure Password Management

- **Use a strong master password**: Ensure it’s hard to guess and not shared with others.
- **Regularly update your passwords**: For increased security, update your passwords periodically.
- **Store your master password securely**: Remember, losing your master password means losing access to the encrypted file.
